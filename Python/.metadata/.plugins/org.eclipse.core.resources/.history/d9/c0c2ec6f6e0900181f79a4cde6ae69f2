Unlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not include a system supported installation of Python.
To make Python available, the CPython team has compiled Windows installers (MSI packages) with every release for many years.
These installers are primarily intended to add a per-user installation of python, with the core interpreter and library being used by a single user.
Python is an interpreted, object oriented, high level programming language with dynamic semantics.
